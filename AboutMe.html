			<h3>1. My Hobbies!</h3>
				<p>When it comes to my various hobbies, I often enjoy exploring and outgoing for walks around all over as I am very fascinated when it comes to viewing the outside world. I also take a huge amount of my time when it comes to playing video games (mostly games from Nintendo such as Mario games or anything on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Nintendo Wii</a>).</p>

		<h3>3. My Background!</h3>
			<p>My background is Filipino although I wasn't born in the country <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a> and more so here in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>, my older siblings, family and their families were born in that country. I have visited my home country once back in the Christmas of 2018 and I know I don't have much else to say since I didn't grew up from there but what I will say is that, it's <i>quite</i> the place where both my <b>Mom</b> and <b>Dad</b> grew up.</p>
