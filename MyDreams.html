			<h3>1. Wanting to become a Computer Programmer.</h3>
			<p>My first dream in life is wanting to become a computer programmer in the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> field. It's always been my interest to learn about coding ever since my dad has first involved me about the space and it soon developed a huge spark in me to learn more about computers and soon make a career out of it. Currently, I am still partaking in studies at <a href="https://humber.ca/"><abbr title="The Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning official website.">Humber College</abbr></a> and I hope soon that I can take that knowledge to build up my career.</p>

			<h3>2. Exploring the World.</h3>
			<p>I always a wonder of wanting to explore the world mostly because I find fascination of the environment around us and the many wonders of nature. Although my journey is quite limited on where I can go for now, I hope in the near future to make enough money to go traveling and explore the many countries I haven't been to yet. I still have to work quite a bit for the travel money but in the end, will be worth it.</p>

		<h3>3. Leaving a Impact/Change.</h3>
			<p>Although there are many dreams I could list down for myself, I <i>definitely</i> will say that one I wish to achieve one day is that I want to leave a impact for the technology world. I hope that one day, I can create software that will impact the life of our world and hope to build a brighter future for tomorrow. Technology still leaves room to innovate and by the many wonders we have created over the years, I hope do that I can also leave some good change as well.</p>
